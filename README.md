<h1 background="#ff0000">MobileV2 - A Discord theme based on the 2023 Discord Mobile TabsV2 Layout</h1>

<h3 background="#ff0000">As of March 11, 2024, MobileV2 has been discontinued. I was already planning do discontinue MobileV2, but with the soft launch of Cyan 2 being just about a week ago, and with only a few months ahead of me before the full update on May 1, I decided to completely shift my focus to Cyan 2 and Poject Mumbo, both of which will be getting released on that day.</h3>

### MobileV2 is a port of the 2023 TabsV2 layout of the Discord Mobile app.
